# Title : Medicinal Plant Detection System using CNN with plant booking portal.

# Description :

Ayurvedic medicine is ancient medicine. This therapeutic approach makesuse of plant materials that are used in
Ayurvedic medicine. The plants need to be identified because they differ from the many other plant species that can be found in 
nature. Without the proper knowledge, it could be difficult for the typical person to identify locally available herbal remedies. 
This demonstration shows a new technique that uses convolutional neural networks(CNN) and leaf images to identify the leaves
of Ayurvedic medicinal plants. Computer technology advancements have allowed the field of computer vision to expand to
include a wide range of applications.One of its applications is image classification, where it recognizes images more accurately 
than traditional methods. This document contains all of the information and direction needed to complete each step of the 
implementation process. All of the basic steps are covered in great detail, including building a database by gathering images and
training models. Compared to other methods, our deep neural network method yields a more accurate classification. Another
benefit is easier feature extraction from the image, which can be fed into the model without requiring preprocessing. One way to
feed deep convolutional neural networks iswith rawphoto data. Without needingtoextract the leavesthemselves, we can precisely
classifyleavesusing deep neural networks, which capture and store visual properties as an imagemovesthrough several layers. Web
applications and deep learning are used to sort and present worksheets. The deep learning technology used in this essay is the
convolutional neural network.
